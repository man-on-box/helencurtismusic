Helen's musical journey began at a young age nurtured within a musical family and upbringing. As a trained classical pianist, Helen's natural inclination to rhythm and close harmony as well as her Swiss maternal roots have led her to the sounds of Eastern Europe, Switzerland,Georgia, Brazil and Cuba.

Helen is an artist with the internationally acclaimed arts organisation Global Grooves and is pianist and coro singer in the top Cuban band Charanga Del Norte.

**Since graduating** from Leeds College of Music in 2000, Helen has continued to seek out inspiring mentors who can continue to feed her instatiable desire for music.

Helen believes that music can benefit everyone- playing an instrument and singing stimulates the brain, and improves mental well-being, it can develop self confidence and is a wonderful way of meeting new friends. Music is so vast, with so many potential experiences and so much music to explore and hear. You could be practicing at home or playing with a small ensemble or a large group, you could be in a quiet musical setting or the polar opposite at carnival hemmed by thousands of jostling people. It is a great builder of the self and the community. Through music you may learn about life, people, the mind and the world.

**Music is intangible and ever-lasting adventure.**

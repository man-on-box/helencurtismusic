Helen believes that music can benefit everyone- playing an instrument and singing stimulates the brain, and improves mental well-being, it can develop self confidence and is a wonderful way of meeting new friends. Music is so vast, with so many potential experiences and so much music to explore and hear. You could be practicing at home or playing with a small ensemble or a large group, you could be in a quiet musical setting or the polar opposite at carnival hemmed by thousands of jostling people. It is a great builder of the self and the community. Through music you may learn about life, people, the mind and the world.

Music is intangible and ever-lasting adventure.

We are so excited to have finally made it the studio, recording with Calluna Sun. It was a productive and immersive day, and we can't wait to share the final releases with you. After searching for a studio with a good acoustic piano, the right vibe and the right sound, we knew that we had found our place with Valley Wood Studios and Barkley McKay. It is as relaxing and professional studio as possible taking out the recording jitters that can occur. It enables you to focus on the live recording and connective performance.

Recording is hard core! It requires such intense focus for an extended period of time. You have to be completely prepared and practiced for the music making and you have to have trained yourself mentally- but it's such a joy when it goes well.

Being together with my sister Louise Curtis feels so special in this sibling duo, we are looking forward to the mixing stage on the 23rd June, then the mastering... and finally out into the world.

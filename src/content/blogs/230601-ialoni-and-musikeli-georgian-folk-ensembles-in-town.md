What an incredible journey it has been. After 3 years... to again hear the live sounds of two amazing Georgian choirs. It is an effort to organise any concert or musical event, but as soon as the live music starts, it is immediate and worth it. The tears come to the eyes, and you are transported to a place that is hard to describe. The experience of live music is so intangible, and yet it stays with you in your molecules and leaves you wanting more.

Ialoni are utterly mesmerising, their performances are beyond this world. So strong and powerful and yet delicate as a butterfly. I feel in awe- and I feel inspired.
